            "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, <br>
            a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
            Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as <br>
            Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
            which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. <br>
            When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard<br>
            (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,<br>
            stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
            Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, <br>
            "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</P>
